# Rock Solid Ops - Operations Platform

> **RockSolid OPS** - Internal staff operations platform for Foundation School.
> Manages student registration, teacher scheduling, attendance, cohort batches, notifications, Moodle enrollment, and milestone tracking.
> **Status: MVP Ready - Supabase-first backend, pilot launch ready (May 2026).**

---

> **Portfolio Summary:** Full production operations platform for a school. Replaced a legacy Google Sheets + Apps Script backend with Supabase Edge Functions, a multi-stage email pipeline with retry/trace infrastructure, Moodle LMS sync, and a staff portal managing the student lifecycle from registration to graduation.

## Architecture Overview

```
Public Registration Form
  -> registration-processor (canonical intake)
     -> ASSIGNED -> moodle-sync
     -> WAITLISTED -> waitlist queue + class selection
     -> DUPLICATE/REVIEW -> admin review

Notification pipeline:
  scheduled_notifications (PENDING)
    -> notification-batch-processor
    -> email_queue (Pending)
    -> email-sender (every 15 minutes)

Operations layer:
  retry-worker (every 20 min)
  missed-class-detector
  clickup-sync
  student-engagement-monitor
  report-generator

Portals:
  /foundation/staff/*   (admin/staff shell)
  /foundation/teacher/* (teacher shell)

Data:
  Supabase Postgres with RLS
```

## What This Is

Foundation School is an internal staff operations platform (not public SaaS). It is used by admins, regional secretaries, and teachers to run the student lifecycle:

- Intake registrations from the public form
- Assign students to batches and classes
- Manage teacher availability and attendance
- Sync assigned students to Moodle
- Send lifecycle emails
- Track milestones and engagement
- Surface failures, retries, and audit events

Backend migration from Google Apps Script + Sheets to Supabase Postgres + Edge Functions completed in May 2026.

## Core Features

### 1. Registration Pipeline

Canonical intake path: `registration-processor` only.

- Validates and normalizes payload
- Writes applicants and workflow state
- Resolves fellowship/group/subgroup
- Produces status: `PENDING`, `ASSIGNED`, `WAITLISTED`, `DUPLICATE`, `REVIEW`
- Triggers downstream notifications
- Writes trace/audit entries

Rules:
- WAITLISTED students are never enrolled in Moodle
- DUPLICATE status is preserved and visible

### 2. Admin Portal

Located at `foundation/staff/`, using `admin-shell.js`.

Key pages include: `admin-dashboard.html`, `admin-review.html`, `applicant-directory.html`, `batch-management.html`, `class-editor.html`, `teacher-management.html`, `waitlist.html`, `notification-center.html`, `messages.html`, `failed-sync-retry-center.html`, `system-health.html`, `audit-log.html`, `reports.html`, `dashboards.html`.

Shell UX:
- Mobile hamburger + backdrop sidebar behavior
- Smooth page transitions with top progress bar during nav
- Teacher-mode switch for eligible admin roles (`regional_secretary`, `admin`, `superadmin`)

### 3. Teacher Portal

Located at `foundation/teacher/`, using `teacher-shell.js`.

- Teacher auth linkage required
- Availability submission
- Roster/class view
- Attendance submission via `teacher-attendance.html`
- Milestone updates
- In-app messaging section via `index.html?section=messages`

Teacher actions are routed through `teacher-portal-api`.

Shell UX:
- Mobile hamburger + backdrop sidebar behavior
- Smooth page transitions with top progress bar during nav

### 4. Batch and Class Management

- Batch lifecycle: `DRAFT`, `UPCOMING`, `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `ARCHIVED`
- Class options include day/time/fellowship mappings
- Supports multi-campus fellowship selection

### 5. Attendance and Session Outcomes

- Attendance data stored in canonical attendance tables
- Deduplication hardening in migrations
- Late-start handling supported
- Reminder/detector workers for missing attendance

### 6. Milestones

- Definitions are admin-managed
- Student milestone status tracked per student/milestone
- Includes `water_baptized`

### 7. Notifications and Email Pipeline

Pipeline:

- `scheduled_notifications` (PENDING)
- `notification-batch-processor`
- `email_queue`
- `email-sender`

### 8. Moodle Enrollment Sync

- Function: `moodle-sync`
- Queue: `moodle_enrollment_sync`
- Enroll ASSIGNED only
- Failure classification for WAF/permissions/REST disabled/unknown 403

### 9. Retry and Recovery Center

- UI: `failed-sync-retry-center.html`
- Worker: `retry-worker`
- Manual helper: `notification-retry-helper`

### 10. ClickUp Escalation

- Function: `clickup-sync`
- Idempotency via `clickup_task_links`

### 11. Waitlist Processor

- Function: `waitlist-processor`
- Supports class-selection token flow

### 12. Student Engagement Monitoring

- Function: `student-engagement-monitor`
- Surfaces at-risk signals

### 13. Reports and Data Exports

- Function: `report-generator`
- UI: `reports.html`, `data-exports.html`

### 14. System Health and Operational Trace

- UI: `system-health.html`
- JS: `system-health.js`, `operational-trace.js`
- Trace RPC: `public.get_operational_trace(...)`

### 15. Fellowship and Subgroup Management

- UI: `fellowship-management.html`
- Table: `fellowship_map`

### 16. Audit Logging

- Canonical table: `public.audit_logs`

### 17. Auth and RBAC

Roles in `profiles.role` include: `superadmin`, `admin`, `regional_secretary`, `pastor`, `subgroup_admin`, `principal`, `teacher`, `pending`.

Note: current access is primarily role-based; regional data scoping is not globally enforced in every flow by default.

### 18. In-App Messaging (Phase 1)

- Edge function: `messaging-api`
- Actions: `sendMessage`, `listMessages`, `listConversations`, `markRead`
- DB tables: `message_conversations`, `message_participants`, `message_messages`
- Migration: `202605240200_phase1_in_app_messaging.sql`
- Staff UI: `foundation/staff/messages.html`
- Teacher UI: `foundation/teacher/sections/teacher-messages.html` (routed from teacher portal section)
- Email notification: queues new-message alerts into `email_queue` using `template_key = direct_message`
- Jurisdiction scope model:
  - `teacher`: class-linked scope (derived from assigned class options)
  - `subgroup_admin`: subgroup scope
  - `pastor`: fellowship/group scope
  - `regional_secretary`: Canada-wide scope
  - `admin/superadmin`: full scope

## Known Issues

| Issue | Location | Status |

## Tech Debt Register (Summary)

| Area | Risk | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Assignment logic split across `registration-processor` and `phase2-processor` | High | Q3 2026 |
| Remaining `fs-*` migration gaps | Medium | Q3-Q4 2026 |
| Schema fallback loops in some functions | Medium | Q4 2026 |
| Per-page style duplication | Medium | Q4 2026 |
| Legacy audit fallback paths | Medium | Q3 2026 |

---

## Security Rules

Before PR:

- No real credentials in git
- RLS enabled on new tables
- Server-side auth checks on privileged functions
- No client-only authorization assumptions
- Additive/idempotent migrations

Never:

- Add a second registration pipeline
- Enroll WAITLISTED students in Moodle
- Remove RLS from protected tables
- Expose service role operations publicly

## Legacy Archive

`archive/apps-script-legacy/` is read-only historical reference and not part of runtime.

---

## Latest Updates (May 2026)

- Shell navigation now uses smooth transition states (fade + subtle lift) for both admin and teacher portals.
- Top loading progress bar added during cross-page navigation in both shells.
- Mobile shell behavior standardized: slide-in sidebar + backdrop + body lock class (`fs-sidebar-open`).
- Shared responsive utility rules in `foundation/ui/primitives.css` expanded for tables, drawers, modals, and KPI grids.
- Help guide hardened for public access (works without auth config) with optional role filtering when session/config is available.
- `scheduled_notifications` dedupe writes moved away from `ON CONFLICT (dedupe_key)` pattern to explicit dedupe lookup + insert where needed.

Generated May 2026. Keep updated as platform evolves.
